This project was done for a heathcare student at Utah Valley University. In this project, I compare the reported comfort levels of heathcare professionals in treating a rare condition known as PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections) before and after watching an instructional video. This is done in R using Fisher’s exact test with p-values calculated by Monte Carlo simulation.
